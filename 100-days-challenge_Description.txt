🚀Hello, network!👋

Time has gone quickly. When I look back ten days, I realize I had no detailed way to learn DSA. But after searching through over 50+ websites and spending more than ten days exploring for the "Best DSA Roadmap," I finally found these best resources:
Strivers A2Z DSA Course: https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2

In hashing, separate chaining is a technique used to resolve collisions that occur when adding keys with the same hash index. It's employed in the internal implementation of HashMaps, along with operations like put(), get(), set(), remove(), size(), and contains(). While learning about HashMaps, I also gained some basics of single linked lists, which play a crucial role in separate chaining by managing collisions between new and existing keys that map to the same index.

LeetCode :

🚀P1 : Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters : 
		https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description

Initially i opted for a brute force approach, which had a time complexity close to quadratic. However, after viewing others solution 
their code clear and effective. I carefully analyzed their techniques step by step. Through this hands-on practice, I discovered the sliding window technique—an effective approach that yields output in linear time, O(n).

LeetCode :

🚀Problem1️⃣: (1838) Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

🔗Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/description

Explanation:

	Task: We need to return the maximum possible Frequency of an element after performing the k -operations.

📌Intuition: 

	The given is sorting at the initial stage and we are using the sliding window.

🔺Reason for sorting the given Array: 

	We are trying to match the element to larger element of the array. Because we cannot increase the element more than the larger element. However if we do that then condition gets violated.

🔺Why sliding window?

	We are looking for the elements(sub-array) that can match to the larger element upto the current element we are in. We are choosing the elements means finding subarrays that can be made equal within k-operations.

 🔸k-operations means by default they were given a value which can be used to make elements equal by incrementing the element with k times. Or we can say like this investing the k value to the array elements in order to make the highest frequency of the subarray.

Coding Ninjas : 
🚀Problem1️⃣: https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/ninja-and-the-second-order-elements_6581960?leftPanelTabValue=SUBMISSION

📌Intuition : 
	🔺Task: Given an array nums of size n need to return the second largest and second smallest element from that array.
	🔺Steps to Findout the second largest and second smallest element :
	1)Declare four variables namely lar, sLar, small and sSmall. 
	2)Assign the value to the variable lar and slar to min_value and assign the value to the variable small and sSmall to max_value
	3)Iterate through the array 
		i. if the current element is larger than the lar variale then assign the slar to lar and lar to current element 
		ii.else check the sLar element is less than the current num and current num is not equal to lar then assign the sLar to current num
		iii. if the current element is smaller than the small variale then assign the sSmall to small and small to current element 
		ii.else check the sSmall element is greater than the current num and current num is not equal to small then assign the current num to sSmall variable
	4)after iterating through entire array we have the second largert element and second smallest element
	5)end
	We gonna with linear time[O(n)].

LeetCode : 

🚀Problem1️⃣:: https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array
📌Intuition : 
	🔺Task: Given an array of nums which is in ascending order need to return the squares of each element in an array in ascending arder
	
🔺🔺Approach : Two Pointers 
* Initially we are declaring the two variables called right which is lenght of an array and left which is 0 index
* We are taking an empty array result of size n (which is original array length)
* In order to stores the result elements in result array we are declaring another variable called index which is points to last index initially.
* we are checking the left index element  with right index element by converting both with non-negative
* if left element is less than right element that means we are storing right element by making it square into result array of index(index variable)
* then decrement both the right and index value by 1
* else storing the left element by making it square into result array of index(index variable)
* then increment the left variable by 1 and decrement the index value by 1
* repeat above four steps till left > right
* return the result array
* end.

🚀Hello, network!👋

Today's Focus solving problem:👇

LeetCode : 

🚀Problem 1️⃣: (15)3Sum:
	Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/
Statement :Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and 		  nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0. 
🔺🔺Intuition:
	we are using two pointers.
	Result does not contain duplicate sets so we need to focus on duplicates  to remove
🪜Steps: 
* Sort the given array which would take O(N*logn) time
* Iterating thourgh the array and choosing the start element which is at index 0. Let's store in target
* we are making the target negotiate 
* by using two pointer we get the sum of two elements which would equal to target 
* if any change duplicates occurs we just skip to next element 
* if sum is equal to target we are adding the index at current elements to result List
* this will repeat until the iteration gets over


📈Time Complexity:
O(N* log n) --> sorting the array
O(N * N) --> two loops of size n
overall O(N * N)

📈Space Complexity:
Constant[O(1)]

LeetCode :
🚀Problem 1️⃣: (18) 4Sum:
	Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/description/
	Intuition: Same as 3Sum program. I have explained in detail. You check the Yesterday's post for 3Sum program >>>>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lakshmanmidhyakula123_100daysofdsa-dsachallenge-java-activity-7149448389879881728-gh4h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android
	📈Time Complexity : O(N^3)
 	📈Space Complexity: O(no of Quadruplets) worst-case scenario O(n^2)

🚀Problem 2️⃣: (189) Rotate Array :
	Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/
🔺🔺Intuition: 
	Task: Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
	I comeup with more than two approaches but i am going to explain the two best approaches.
	Similarites in both Approaches:
	* If the k is more than the given array length, we just modulo the k with array length then it would be easy to get the rotated array.
	📈Time complexity : O(n)

Approach 1:
	* Declaring the two variables called i and origK and assign the values 0 and k respectively
	* create an array of size n and name it as temp
	* we are storing the values from length minus k (length - k ) to total length from original array to temp array 
	* after the above step index of i points to k + 1 th element 
	* then storing the 0 index to lenght - origk element of orignal array to temp array which starts at index i
	* end.
📈Time complexity  : O(n)
📈Space Complexity : O(n)

Approach 2: 
	* Swapping at 0 th index to (lenght - k - 1 )th index elements of given array nums
	* Swapping at (lenght - k - 1 )th index to end index elements of given array nums
	* Swapping at 0 th index to end index elements of given array nums
	* End.

📈Time complexity  : O(3n) --->after removing less Dominating terms O(n)
📈Space Complexity : O(1)

Coding Ninjas:
🚀Problem 1️⃣: Merge 2 Sorted Array 	
	Link : https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/sorted-array_6613259?leftPanelTabValue=PROBLEM
🔺Intuition : 
	Task : They have given two sorted arrays namely a and b. We need to return result as the list such that it contains the unique elements of both arrays
	
🤗Approach: 
	Simple merge sort but need to handle the duplicates in both arrays thats all.

What is MergeSort? 
	MergeSort is a sorting algorithm which is perform operations based on divide and conqure. 
In our case we have the arrays are already sorted need to merge thats all. However there might be duplicates in both arrays so remove and merge.

🪜Steps:
	*Iterate through both arrays simultaneously:
	*Compare elements at current indices:
	*If equal, move both indices forward (skipping duplicates).
	*If different, add the smaller element to the result and move its index forward.
	*Add remaining elements from either array:
	*Handle any remaining duplicates in the result list.

📈Time Complexity : O(m + n) 
		 where m is size of an array a
		       n is size of an array b
📈Space Complexity : O(n) which is resultant list of size n 


LeetCode :
🚀Problem 1️⃣: (75)Sort Colors

🔺Intuition: 
	TASK: We need to sort the given array nums. After sorting the array, the elements are follows 0's , 1's and 2's.

🤗Approach : 
	We gonna with Three-pointer technique for efficient in-place sorting.
Steps: 
	* Initialize three pointers : low , high and replaceZero.
	* Iterate Through the array:
	  * If the element at the low is 2, then swap it with element at high, and decrement the high by 1
	  * If the element at the low is 1, move the low to next element
	  * If the element at the low is 0, then swap it with element at replceZero, and increment low and replaceZero by 1.
	* When the low <= high stop the loop
	* Return the ans.
	
📈Time Complexity: O(n) linear

LeetCode :

🚀Problem 1️⃣ : Valid Parentheses(20)
	Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/post-solution/?submissionId=1141434509
🔺Intuition: 
	Task: Given a String containing characters like (, ), [, ], { and }, determine the string is valid if the brackets are match with correspoing brackets.

🤗Approach :
	Using the Stack data Structure we do solve this problem.
🤔Why Stack ? 
	Stack is a data structure which is follows LIFO(Last in First out) structure. It is mainly used for navigating to previous and current pages, files, links, and etc.☺️ 

Steps for solving 
* Declare the Stack data Structure
* Iterate through the string 
* if any opening bracket encounter such as (, [ and { simply add to the stack 
* if the current character in string is closing bracket such as ), ] and } and check with the top of stack whether it is match with correspoing bracket 
* if match pop(remove) from the stack 
* if not, return true
* there might be a case if the string contain only closing brackets in that case return false 
* another case to consider, if the string contains opening brackers only, in that case all the characters of string are in stack simply retrun false
* End 

📈Complexities: 
📈Time Complexity: O(n) linear time

🚀Hello, network!👋

Today's Focus is solving the problems in leetcode :👇

LeetCode :

🚀Problem 1️⃣ :  (2149) Rearrange Array Elements by Sign
	Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign/

🔺Intuition: 
	Task: Given an array of nums, we need to rearrange them based on the following constraints:
	* Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
	* For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
	* The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
	* The length of an array nums is always even

🤗Approach :
	Using simple for loop we can able to solve this problem.
	
🤔Why For loop?
	Using a for loop, we can through the array. The loop will continue until the end of the array reached. At iteration, we can access the current element and perform specific operations based on its value. 
	In order to rearrange them. We gonna with for loop.
	

Steps for solving :
* Declare and initialize two variables even = 0, and odd = 1
* Declare a new array called res of size n
* Iterate through the array nums if the loop encounters the current value is positive number then store at even index position in resultant array called res
* after that increment the even variable by 2
* if loop encounters current value is negative number then store value at odd index in resultant array called res
* increment the odd value by 2
* end

🚀Hello, network!👋

📌📌Today's Focus is about learning new concept and solving the problems in leetcode :👇
Topic Name : 
* SubSets and SubSequence : 
	Thanks to #kunalKushwaha for providing such a great videos on DSA. Kunal Kushwaha's videos are indeed a great resource for DSA concepts.
	SubSet is a arranging or selecting the elements from a set in any order or in different ways. It is like permutations. I have a little bit knowledge on permutations, how do find permutations like that stuff. When i watch kunal kushwaha permutations videos, that helps me to understand very clearly about it. 

while i was watching permutation video, My mind grasp one line "Never Forgot about basics". This single line have a depth meaning it helps to solve the 80% of problem and a vast majority of problems


***Today's problem is not about permuations***

Leetcode page is working for a while when i was doing the solution.. Is there any reason behind it. Let me know your answers in the comment section

🚀Problem 1️⃣ : (1207)Unique Number of Occurrences
✌️Difficulty Level:  Easy
	🔗Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/post-solution/?submissionId=1148473870


Intuition

1* First we gonna sort the given array which would be easy to count the no of unique occurences. 
2* Right after that comparing the adjacent elements till not match mean time increasing the count.
3* Then store the count in set data structure 
4* The movement when the count occures two times with the same value, we stop iterating and return false.
5* If we reach end of array then return true.

🔺Approach
Two Pointers

Complexities:
📈Time Complexity: O(n)
📈Space Complexity: Number of unique count which is near about O(log n)
